# Internships
 <h1> C# and Python internship through Prosperity Consulting Inc.</h1>
 <h2> C# </h2>
 <p> For the C# internship I was required to create a functioning CRUD pages for rental Survey of the website. I was also charged with styling the rental survey pages as well as the creation of them. From there I created a Partial View of the index that was applied within the view. This partial view can also be applied anywhere throughout the website going forward. </p>
 <h3> Python</h3>
 <p> For the Python internship I was charged with creating a mobile app for book tracking. This app allows you to create a list of books you are interested in, as well as a rating for them. It also has links to bestsellers to give you ideas for upcoming books that you may be interested in. </p>
